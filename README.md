# Ionic Framework for Rails 4
Make [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com) into Rails Engine. 

## Version
Ionic Framework 1.0.0-beta.11

## Rails 4 or later
Include Gemfile,

    gem 'ionic-rails-engine'

Add javascripts into application.js

    //= require ionic/ionic

Similiarly add stylesheet into application.css

## CDN (not supported yet)

This gem supports cdn the same as [jquery-rails-cdn](https://github.com/yjchen/jquery-rails-cdn). In the application layout, add

    = ionic_js_include_tag :default

and remove corresponding lines in application.js.

### Options

Set :compressed to use minimized library locally like this:

    = ionic_js_include_tag :default, :compressed => true

Set :local_copy true to use local copy when CDN is not available.

Remember to add assets name in confign/environments/production.rb:

    config.assets.precompile += %w( ionic/ionic.min.js)
